# Kata-api in Dart

Hello there !

This is an attempt to make dart known among Back-end devs by doing a basic CRUD API using a clean architecture


I use Supabase as a db and mainly shelf for HTTP requests in Dart

## TO RUN

To run the project : `dart run`

*the `pubspec.yaml` has a name attribute and it will automatically find the .dart file in `/bin` to launch it*

## TO TEST

To run tests : `dart run test`

*All the `*_test.dart` are recognized as test files*
