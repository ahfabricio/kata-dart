# Kata-api in Dart

Hello there !

This is an attempt to make dart known among Back-end devs by doing a basic CRUD API using a clean architecture


I use Supabase as a db and mainly shelf for HTTP requests in Dart

## TO RUN

> Dart SDK to install : [SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

To run the project : `dart run`

*the `pubspec.yaml` has a name attribute and it will automatically find the .dart file in `/bin` to launch it*

> For develpoment I advise to use [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) like this : `nodemon -x "dart run" -e dart` so the server can restart at each change you do

## TO TEST

To run tests : `dart run test`

*All the `*_test.dart` inside `/test` are recognized as test files*
